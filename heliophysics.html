        <h2>Coronal Mass Ejections</h2>
        <img src="../images/research/cme.png" alt="CME">
        <p> With the addition of Parker Solar Probe (PSP), we are able to study Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) in situ very close to the Sun to better understand their dynamics
            and evolution. On September 5th 2022, a very energetic CME (known as the Labor Day CME), passed over PSP, leading to new and interesting results:<br><br>
            During the thirteenth encounter of the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) mission, the spacecraft traveled through a topologically complex Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection (ICME) 
            beginning on September 5th 2022. PSP traversed through the flank and wake of the ICME while observing the event for nearly two days. The Solar Probe ANalyzer (SPAN) 
            and FIELDS instruments collected in situ measurements of the plasma particles and magnetic field at 13.3 Rs from the Sun. We observe classical ICME signatures, 
            such as a fast-forward shock, bidirectional electrons, low proton temperatures, low plasma beta, and high alpha particle to proton number density ratios. 
            In addition, PSP traveled through two magnetic inversion lines, a magnetic reconnection exhaust, and multiple sub-Alfvenic regions. We compare these in situ measurements 
            to remote sensing observations from the Wide-field Imager for Solar PRobe Plus (WISPR) instrument on board PSP and the Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation 
            (SECCHI) on STEREO. Based on white-light coronagraphs, two CMEs are forward modeled to best fit the extent of the event. Furthermore, ADAPT-GONG magnetograms and Potential Field 
            Source Surface (PFSS) modeling portray a global reconfiguration of the Heliospheric Current Sheet (HCS) after the CME event, suggesting these eruptions play a significant role 
            in the evolution of the HCS.

        <p> I have contributed to studies of solar flares, high-energy eruptions on the Sun that release intense X-ray and particle radiation, 
            primarily through my hands-on work with the FOXSI-4 sounding rocket mission. I helped to assemble, test, and integrate the 
            Solar Aspect and Alignment System (SAAS) instrument, which is a white-light telescope for guiding the X-ray measurements. I also performed laser
            and X-ray alignment tests and simulations for the seven X-ray optics modules on the payload. This involved supporting mulitple stages of rocket
            integration at SSL, WSMR, and PFRR. During the rocket's launch window, I helped to monitor solar conditions to capture real-time observations of 
            an M-class solar flare.

        <h2>Solar Wind Electrons</h2>
        <img src="../images/research/swelectrons.png" alt="SW Electrons">
        <p> The SPAN-E (Solar Probe ANalyzer–Electrons) instrument on board Parker Solar Probe (PSP) measures the three-dimensional distribution of solar wind electrons, 
            providing observations of low energy electrons throughout the inner Heliosphere. I have contributed to the calibration and development of high-quality data products from SPAN-E, 
            including core distribution fits and total electron moments, ensuring accurate measurements across a wide range of energies and pitch angles. I have also helped with 
            generating Quasi-Thermal Noise (QTN) electron density measurements, SPAN-I (Solar Probe ANalyzer–Ions) FOV restrictions, and spacecraft electrostatic potential values for the 
            entire mission. Using these datasets, I have studied electron strahl scattering mechanisms, investigating which processes are more dominant in either focusing or broadening
            the electron strahl, and found that Coulomb collisions may play a more major role closer to the Sun compared to other mechanisms.
